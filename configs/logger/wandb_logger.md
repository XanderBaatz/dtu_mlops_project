For the [Weights and Biases logger](wandb.yaml) to work, one must fill out the following in one's `.env` file in the root directory:
```txt
WANDB_API_KEY=...
WANDB_PROJECT=...
WANDB_ENTITY=...
```

In our case it's:
```txt
WANDB_API_KEY=[hidden]
WANDB_PROJECT=dtu_mlops_project
WANDB_ENTITY=mlops_group80
```
